# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test model button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# Getting Started Question
#
# Given this data, train a neural network to match the xs to the ys
# So that a predictor for a new value of X will give a float value
# very close to the desired answer
# i.e. print(model.predict([10.0])) would give a satisfactory result
# The test infrastructure expects a trained model that accepts
# an input shape of [1]

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def solution_model():
    xs = np.array([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)
    ys = np.array([-4.0, 1.0, 6.0, 11.0, 16.0, 21.0], dtype=float)

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=[1])
    ])
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='sgd')
    model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)

    print(model.predict([10.0]))
    return model

# Note that you'll need to save your model as a .h5 like this.
# When you press the Submit and Test button, your saved .h5 model will
# be sent to the testing infrastructure for scoring
# and the score will be returned to you.
