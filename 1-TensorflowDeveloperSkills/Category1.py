# Getting Started Question
#
# Given this data, train a neural network to match the xs to the ys
# So that a predictor for a new value of X will give a float value
# very close to the desired answer
# i.e. print(model.predict([10.0])) would give a satisfactory result
# The test infrastructure expects a trained model that accepts
# an input shape of [1]

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def solution_model():
    xs = np.array([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)
    ys = np.array([-4.0, 1.0, 6.0, 11.0, 16.0, 21.0], dtype=float)

    # YOUR CODE HERE

    return model

# Note that you'll need to save your model as a .h5 like this.
# When you press the Submit and Test button, your saved .h5 model will
# be sent to the testing infrastructure for scoring
# and the score will be returned to you.

    model = solution_model()
    model.save("mymodel.h5")
