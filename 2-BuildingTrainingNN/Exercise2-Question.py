# ## Exercise 2
# In the course you learned how to do classificaiton using Fashion MNIST, a data set containing items of clothing. There's another, similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.
# 
# Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.
# 
# Some notes:
# 1. It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs= to 10, but nothing larger
# 2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string "Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!"
# 3. If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class
# 
# I've started the code for you below -- how would you finish it?

import tensorflow as tf
from os import path, getcwd, chdir

# DO NOT CHANGE THE LINE BELOW. If you are developing in a local
# environment, then grab mnist.npz from the Coursera Jupyter Notebook
# and place it inside a local folder and edit the path to that location
path = f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/mnist.npz"
